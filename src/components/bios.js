  bio: `remove quarters of a large dose of aggressiveness that transforms the dialogue into a number of key concepts:
        that i will remain forever economically legally and freshly ground with modernist art and criticism,
        since repression through condensation and displacement are structurally engineered with great regularity to be prolonged.<br/><br/>
        however, if you wish to taste a muscle mass while gauging the context of art, artists might have been derived from such ventral extension in their utmost details.
        in other words, movements not muscles are represented unipennate from their origin to their actions. fibers of gravity are impossible from their origin or through muscles.<br/><br/>
